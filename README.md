# homebrew-core

My packages in a brew tap!

<br>

## How to use this tap?

Just `tap` it!

```
$ brew tap WestleyR/core
```

And just like that, you can now start installing some of my projects/commands.
Heres a couple that you might like:


```
$ brew install tac         # tac for macOS (linux too)

$ brew install whereis     # working 'whereis' command for macOS (linux too)

$ brew install list-files  # just like 'ls -l'
```

<br>

### Updating packages

Since you are using `brew`, you can easily update/upgrade all this packages when a new version
is released, just do:

```
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade
```

<br>


#### Uninstalling/untapping

If you ever want to remove a package, you can easily remove it with `brew`:

```
$ brew remove <package>
```

Or even untap (brew will not keep track of `WestleyR/*` packages)

```
$ brew untap WestleyR/core
```
